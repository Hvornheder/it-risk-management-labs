# Lab 02: Performing a Vulnerability Assessment

## Overview
This lab focused on identifying security weaknesses within an IT environment through active scanning and vulnerability assessment techniques. Network discovery, service enumeration, and vulnerability analysis were conducted to identify misconfigurations, insecure services, and exploitable conditions. The goal was to assess risk and recommend appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Objectives
- Identify active hosts, open ports, and running services
- Perform vulnerability scans using industry-standard tools
- Analyze vulnerability severity using CVSS scoring
- Recommend remediation strategies to reduce risk exposure

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Nmap / Zenmap (network scanning and service enumeration)
- Nessus (automated vulnerability scanning)
- OpenVAS (vulnerability assessment)
- Traceroute
- SSL/TLS analysis
- CVE and CVSS scoring references

## Key Activities
- Conducted network scans to identify active hosts, open ports, and exposed services
- Performed OS detection and service fingerprinting using Nmap and Zenmap
- Executed vulnerability scans using Nessus and OpenVAS
- Reviewed scan results to identify high, medium, and low severity findings
- Evaluated vulnerabilities related to weak credentials, outdated services, and SSL misconfigurations
- Analyzed CVE data and CVSS scores to prioritize remediation efforts

## Key Findings
- Identified high-severity vulnerabilities including weak database credentials and service backdoors
- Detected SSL/TLS misconfigurations, including medium-strength cipher support and untrusted certificates
- Observed insecure service configurations that increased exposure to man-in-the-middle attacks

## Remediation Recommendations
- Enforce strong password policies and authentication controls
- Patch or replace vulnerable services and validate software packages
- Configure SSL/TLS to use trusted certificates and strong encryption standards
- Perform regular vulnerability scanning and continuous monitoring

## Key Takeaways
This lab reinforced the importance of proactive vulnerability management in maintaining a secure IT environment. Regular scanning, accurate risk assessment, and timely remediation are critical to reducing attack surfaces and preventing exploitation. The exercise demonstrated how vulnerability assessment supports informed security decision-making.
