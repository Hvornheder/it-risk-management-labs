# Lab 01: Exploring the Seven Domains of IT Infrastructure Security

## Overview
This lab focused on understanding the Seven Domains of a Typical IT Infrastructure and how security controls, access restrictions, and network configurations differ across each domain. The objective was to analyze how vulnerabilities emerge within interconnected systems and how proper controls mitigate risk.

## Objectives
- Understand the structure and purpose of the Seven Domains of IT Infrastructure
- Identify security risks associated with each domain
- Analyze access controls, network segmentation, and secure communication methods
- Apply foundational IT risk management concepts

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Command-line utilities
- PuTTY (remote access)
- Firewall rule analysis
- ARP tables
- NAT configurations
- DNS configuration review
- VPN concepts (split-tunnel vs full-tunnel)

## Key Activities
- Navigated between infrastructure domains to analyze access restrictions
- Reviewed firewall rules and network traffic behavior
- Examined ARP tables, NAT behavior, and DNS resolution
- Evaluated secure network design principles across domains

## Key Takeaways
This lab reinforced the importance of domain-specific security controls and demonstrated how misconfigurations in one domain can introduce risk across an entire infrastructure. The exercise emphasized proactive monitoring, proper segmentation, and secure configuration as critical components of IT risk management.
