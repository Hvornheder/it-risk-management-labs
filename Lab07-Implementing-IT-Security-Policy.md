# Lab 07: Implementing an IT Security Policy

## Overview
This lab focused on implementing and enforcing IT security policies across enterprise user accounts, endpoint protection systems, and mobile devices. The primary objective was to understand how formal security policies translate into technical controls that prevent misconfigurations, reduce user-side risk, and support organizational security and compliance requirements.

## Objectives
- Implement and enforce domain-level password and account security policies
- Configure antivirus and endpoint protection policies that cannot be overridden by users
- Apply mobile device security controls including encryption and device protection
- Understand the role of Acceptable Use and Privacy Policies in governance and compliance

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Active Directory Group Policy Management
- Windows Domain Security Policies
- Microsoft Defender Antivirus (real-time protection)
- Android security controls (Google Play Protect, device encryption)
- Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
- Security policy documentation (AUPs and Privacy Policies)

## Key Activities
- Configured domain password policies including complexity requirements, expiration intervals, and account lockout thresholds using Group Policy Management
- Enforced real-time antivirus protection settings to prevent user disablement
- Verified policy inheritance and application through domain-linked GPOs (e.g., MSDomainSecurity2019)
- Implemented mobile device protections including encryption, secure updates, and remote device tracking
- Reviewed and analyzed Acceptable Use Policies and Privacy Policies to align technical controls with governance standards
- Captured configuration validation through screenshots to confirm successful enforcement

## Key Takeaways
This lab demonstrated that effective IT security begins with clearly defined and enforced policies. Password protection, account lockout rules, antivirus enforcement, and mobile safeguards significantly reduce the risk of common attacks and user-driven security failures. Additionally, the development and enforcement of Acceptable Use and Privacy Policies highlighted the importance of managing user behavior alongside technical controls. Policy enforcement combined with user awareness creates a resilient, layered defense that supports long-term security and compliance.
