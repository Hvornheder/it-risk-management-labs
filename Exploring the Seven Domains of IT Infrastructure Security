# Lab 01 – Exploring the Seven Domains of IT Infrastructure Security

## Objective
To analyze a simulated enterprise IT environment using the seven domains of IT infrastructure model and evaluate how security controls, configurations, and access restrictions protect organizational systems and data.

## Environment Overview
This lab involved hands-on exploration of a multi-domain IT infrastructure including workstation systems, Active Directory, LAN and WAN networking components, firewall appliances, VPN connectivity, and system/application services. The objective was to understand how security controls differ across domains and how misconfigurations can introduce risk.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Windows Server & Windows Workstation environments
- Active Directory & Group Policy Management
- pfSense firewall (NAT, port forwarding, DMZ, LAN rules)
- Command-line tools (ARP, traceroute, DNS lookups)
- PuTTY for secure remote access
- VPN connectivity analysis
- Docker service inspection
- Web application testing environment (OWASP Juice Shop)
- Network storage management interface (TrueNAS-style)

## Key Activities by Domain

### User & Workstation Domains
- Reviewed Windows sign-in options, password policies, and endpoint protection settings
- Observed execution blocking and email attachment security behavior
- Verified user permissions and access restrictions for local and shared resources

### LAN Domain
- Analyzed ARP tables before and after network activity
- Examined switch forwarding tables to understand layer 2 traffic handling
- Tested access to shared directories and validated permission enforcement

### LAN-to-WAN & WAN Domains
- Reviewed outbound NAT configurations and permissive LAN rules
- Analyzed static routing configurations and traceroute results
- Evaluated firewall rules governing DMZ and web server access
- Verified port forwarding behavior for externally accessible services

### Remote Access Domain
- Tested VPN connectivity and determined tunnel configuration (split tunnel)
- Performed reverse DNS lookups to validate internal name resolution
- Assessed secure access to internal services over remote connections

### System / Application Domain
- Reviewed Active Directory group membership and password policies
- Examined DNS entries and service records
- Verified Docker service status and container availability
- Observed a deliberately vulnerable web application to understand application-layer exposure
- Inspected storage volumes and disk configurations

## Key Takeaways
- Each IT infrastructure domain introduces unique security risks requiring domain-specific controls
- Access control, segmentation, and monitoring are critical to reducing lateral movement
- Firewall configuration and routing decisions directly impact attack surface exposure
- Secure remote access depends on correct VPN configuration and DNS behavior
- Proper documentation and validation are essential for maintaining a secure enterprise environment
